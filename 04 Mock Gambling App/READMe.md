# 📱 Overview

**BetWise** is a **gambling-themed session tracker app** built for educational purposes. The app allows users to track **virtual casino sessions using fake chips**.

This makes the project more engaging while still covering all required app development concepts such as:

* authentication
* data capture
* Room database storage
* filtering and reporting
* charts and dashboards
* gamification
* Firebase integration
* GitHub version control
* automated testing

⚠️ **Important:**
This app **does not involve real gambling or real money**.
It is a **simulation app designed purely for learning Android development**.

---

# 🎯 Purpose of the App

The goal of BetWise is to help you practise building a **complete Android application**.

You will learn how to:

* design and build a multi-screen mobile application
* manage user input and validation
* persist data locally and online
* create interactive dashboards and reports
* implement gamification elements
* use GitHub professionally with CI/CD workflows

---

# 🎲 App Concept

BetWise is based on a **casino session tracking theme**.

Users log **virtual betting sessions** using fake chips. Each session records:

* the game category
* number of chips used
* session start and end time
* notes or description
* optional screenshot or photo

Users can then analyse their activity through **reports, graphs, and progress dashboards**.

Example categories include:

* 🎰 Slots
* ♠️ Poker
* 🎯 Roulette
* 🃏 Blackjack
* 🏈 Sports Picks

---

# 🚀 Main Features

## 🔐 User Authentication

Users can:

* register with a username and password
* log in securely
* log out of the application

This feature demonstrates authentication handling and navigation between screens.

---

## 🃏 Game Categories

Users can create and manage categories for different session types.

Example categories:

* Slots
* Poker
* Roulette
* Blackjack
* Lucky Wheel

Each session must belong to a category.

---

## 📝 Session Tracking

Users can log a gambling session with:

* session title
* chip amount
* date
* start time
* end time
* description
* category
* optional image

This simulates the **expense capture functionality required in the PoE**.

---

## 📸 Photo Attachment

Users can optionally attach a photo to a session entry.

Examples:

* game screenshots
* strategy notes
* fake receipts
* leaderboard images


---

## 🎯 Chip Goals

Users can define monthly goals such as:

* minimum chip goal
* maximum chip limit
* category limits

These goals are used to track user performance.

---

## 📅 Session History

Users can view all sessions recorded during a **selected date range**.

The list view allows users to:

* see all recorded sessions
* open a session for detailed information
* view attached images

---

## 📊 Category Totals

The app calculates how many chips were used per category during a selected period.

This helps you practise:

* Room queries
* grouping records
* generating reports

---

## 📈 Graphs and Analytics

The final version of the app includes visual charts that display:

* daily chip usage
* category totals
* spending trends
* minimum and maximum goal markers

These graphs allow users to analyse their behaviour visually.

---

## 📊 Progress Dashboard

The dashboard shows:

* chips used this month
* current minimum and maximum goals
* categories that exceed limits
* overall progress

Overspending categories are highlighted visually.

---

## 🏆 Gamification

To make the app more engaging, BetWise includes a badge system.

Example rewards:

* 🥇 First Session Logged
* 🔥 7-Day Logging Streak

This supports the gamification requirement of the PoE.
